A tree is a connected acyclic undirected graph
* connected: given any two nodes there is a path between them
* acyclic: a graph doesn't have cycle
* undirected: edges can go both way

m-ary trees: every internal vertex of the tree has no more than m children
- binary tree: every nodes that has at most 2 children

Terminology:
* Path: sequence of nodes connected together in a tree
* Parent: a node above another node connected by it's edge
* Child: a node below another node connected by its edge
* Root: the top of tree, only one in the tree, root has no parent
* Leaf node: nodes that no has children
* Tree height: the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf

# Balanced tree:
- the depth of the two subtrees of every nodes never differ by more than 1
